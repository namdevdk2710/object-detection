# Object Detection

The Object Detection project is aimed at identifying objects within images. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and computer vision techniques, this system can accurately recognize and classify various objects in real-time. This capability is crucial for a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, augmented reality, and more, where understanding the visual context is essential.
